Does HBM with a bunch of data break the degeneracy?
-----------
Problem: With Mass and Radius measurements from some exoplanets, can we use HBM to infer the fraction of iron, silicate, and water, from a 3-layer model.
-----------
Test:
Given A,B,C
Draw (a,b,c)s from A,B,C
Calculate y1=8a+3b+c and y2=a+b+c
Now, given (y1,y2)s
Can we find A,B,C?
