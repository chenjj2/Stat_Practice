Assumption: exoplanets belongs to the same category -- rocky planets
But: what about their differences?
1. different host -> original chemical abundance
2. planet evolution -> volatile depletion(temperature<-distance?), stellar wind
3. age of the system -> evolution stage
4. outlier -> e.g. Mecury(possibly hit by something)

Data Selection: how do we choose our sample <- why do we believe that they can be categorize into 1 group

Method: can HBM break the inherent degeneracy of the problem?

Practice: 
1. input grid alpha(iron fraction), beta(silicate fraction), gamma(h2o fraction), mass. constraint: alpha+beta+gamma=1. output radius 
2. bylinear interpolation on mass
